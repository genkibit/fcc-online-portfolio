Portfolio Page
===

Synopsis
---
This is one of a series of projects for the front-end program of **[freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/)**. The goal is to build your
own online portfolio page.

The project rubric is as follows:

+ Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/VemmoX/.
+ Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
+ Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
+ User Story: I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
+ User Story: I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
+ User Story: I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)
+ User Story: I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.
